# Project 3 Report

## Semaphores API
We implemented a Semaphore API as described by the header file to ensure that 
there is good synchronizations between the shared variables. It is up to the 
user to use the API appropriately to ensure that the synchronization 
happens as expected.

### Implementation details
We use the following data structure for semaphores.
```
struct semaphore {
	int count;
	queue_t BLOCKED;
};
```
The count value is incremented, and decremented using up and down. This is used 
to block and unblock the threads as appropriate. The blocked queue contains all 
of the blocked threads in DOWN, when we try to access a critical section, but 
the semaphore currently doesn't let it access it. The threads in the blocked 
queue are released in UP.

#### sem_create(size_t count)
This initializes the new semaphore, assigns the count to the semaphore to assign
an upperbound on the number of threads that can access the area protected by a 
semaphore, and also initializes the BLOCKED queue for the semaphore.

#### sem_destroy(sem_t sem)
If the sem provided is NULL, or if a thread is being blocked in the BLOCKED 
queue for the semaphore, we return -1. or we destroy the queue and then free the 
semaphore.
We consider this to be a critical section, since it is possible that two threads
are trying to destroy the same semaphore. However, we could have a race 
condition in this which could try to free sem twice when it has already been 
freed.

#### sem_down(sem_t sem)
We use this when trying to access something protected by a semaphore. If the 
semaphore is NULL then we return -1. If not, then if the count is not 0, then we 
just decrement it by 1 and return 0. Otherwise the thread needs to be blocked, 
so we block the thread and add it to the BLOCKED queue.
We consider this to be a critical section, since two threads could get the same 
value of count, and decrement it only once instead of decrementing it twice.
(RACE CONDITION)

#### sem_up(sem_t sem)
We use this once we are done with the resource, and want to allow other threads 
to access it if they want to. 
- If the sem provided is NULL, we return -1. 
- If there is a thread in the blocked queue waiting to access the thread, then 
we release it and don't incrememnt the count.
- If nothing is waiting, then we can increment the counter.
This is a critical section as well for the same reason as sem_down. Also, the 
unblocking in the BLOCKED queue could be affected by a RACE condition as well.

#### sem_getvalue(sem_t sem, int sval)
Does what is provided in the header file. Nothing that needs further explanation
here. It is consider a critical section as well since the sem value can be 
modified if a context switch happens after entering it.

### Testing
For testing, we primarily used the three test files given, sem_count.c, sem_buff
er.c, and sem_prime.c. We made sure the output matched what was expected.

## TPS
The goal of the TPS API is to provide a single private and protected memory page
to each thread that requires it.

### Implemention details
To initialize we used a single struct 
```
struct memoryStorage{
	pthread_t* tid;
	char* mmapPtr;
};
```
This sufficed for the first two parts. However, in the last part we had to do 
Copy-on-Write, therefore, we added a different struct called page, and moved the 
pointer to the memory there. Thus, in the final version we have two structs 
defined as follows:
```
struct page {
	char* mmapPtr;
	int refCounter;
};


struct memoryStorage{
	pthread_t* tid;
	struct page* myPage;
};
```
We also have a memoryQueue that checks the mapping from TID to the memory 
assigned to it, if assigned.

#### tps_init(int segv)
- We set the signal handler for SIGBUS, and SIGSEGV. We use the code provided by
the professor for this section with a minor modification. We added a function 
called "find_char" that finds the matching starting address to p_fault. If found 
we print out the tps error message and switch back to the original handler.
```
static int find_char(void *data, void *arg)
{
    struct memoryStorage  *a = (struct memoryStorage*)data;
    char* match = (char*)arg;
    if (a->myPage->mmapPtr == match){
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
- We also initialize the memoryQueue here.
#### tps_create(void)
We create a new memoryStorage struct, assign a new memory using mmap, and set 
the refCounter to 1 here. This struct is added to the memoryQUEUE to know which 
thread ids have been assigned memory.
#### tps_destroy(void)
If the tid is present in the memory queue, it destroys the associated struct 
with the TID and the reference to the page. It also decrements the reference 
counter for the page. If tid is not present then we return -1.
#### tps_read(size_t offset, size_t length, void buffer)
If the length + offset is greater than the size of the memory then we return -1,
or if buffer is null. Otherwise, we use mprotect to allow reading from the 
memory, and read the data to the buffer. We use a function find_tid to find the tid 
within the queue.
```
static int find_tid(void *data, void *arg)
{
    struct memoryStorage  *a = (struct memoryStorage*)data;
    pthread_t match = (pthread_t)arg;
    if (a->tid == match){
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
#### tps_write(size_t offset, size_t length, void buffer)
There are 4 major cases in this. 
- If the the offset + length is greater than tps size or buffer is null return 
-1.
- If on finding the tid in tempStorage, we can't find the TID then we return -1.
- If we find the TID then we need to check the counter value.
If the refCounter value is 1. Then no copy on write was done, thus, we can 
modify the value directly.
- If the refCounter value was superior to 1, then we need to copy the contents 
and then write to it. To do this, we first decrement the refCounter. Then we 
allocate memory to it. After which, we copy the contents from the old page to
this memory, and then write the data from the buffer to the memory. After this,
we set the permission to PROT_NONE.
#### tps_clone(pthread_t tid)
- For the first part, we checked if the currently running thread had 
memoryStorage in the queue. If it did, then we return -1.
- If the tid provided is not present in the queue then we return -1 as well.
- For the first part, we created a new memory block and copies the contents to 
it, and subsequently enqued this memoryStorage to the queue.
```
void *mptr = NULL;
	mptr = mmap(NULL,TPS_SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE| MAP_ANON
,-1,0); // Create memory
	if(mptr == MAP_FAILED){
		return -1;
	} // If failed in memory creation
	struct memoryStorage *cloneStorage = malloc(sizeof(struct memoryStorage)
);
	cloneStorage->myPage = malloc(sizeof(struct page));
	cloneStorage->tid = curTid;
	cloneStorage->myPage->mmapPtr = (char*) mptr;
	struct memoryStorage *temp = (struct memoryStorage*) tempStorage1;
	mprotect(temp->myPage->mmapPtr, TPS_SIZE, PROT_READ);
	memcpy( cloneStorage->myPage->mmapPtr, temp->myPage->mmapPtr, TPS_SIZE);
	mprotect(cloneStorage->myPage->mmapPtr, TPS_SIZE, PROT_NONE);
	mprotect(temp->myPage->mmapPtr, TPS_SIZE, PROT_NONE);
	queue_enqueue(memoryQUEUE, cloneStorage);
```
- However, for the subsequent part, we had to create a page struct and enable 
Copy-on-Write, so we just created a new struct and assigned the page to point 
to the page already made for the tid. We only create a new copy in write now.

### Testing
We created the following tests for our TPS API:
- `test_create()`: simple TPS creation test, that also tests for creating 2
TPS for the same thread
- `test_read_and_write()`: simple test for reading and writing
- `test_offset()`: simple offset test
- `test_clone()`: test if clone properly copies over old TPS content
- `test_clone_bad_tid()`: test for cloning a non-existent TID
- `test_seg()`:  test the segfault handler
